This repository contains the code for solving the equations for the reduced model in Liang et al., 2019, Part I, submitted to JGR-Solid Earth. This reduced model is also used as the forward model for inversion carried out in Liang et al., 2019, Part II, submitted to JGR-Solid Earth. 

This model captures fluid oscillation in a 2D radially symmetric conduit driven by the restoring force from gravity and reservoir stiffness, rigorously capturing the viscous boundary layers on the conduit wall. Fluid compressibility in the reservoir can be lumped into the reservoir stiffness. However, fluid compressibility in the conduit is neglected.
